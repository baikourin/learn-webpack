## Webpack 5 Configuration
This is  `webpack v5` configuration, that I am using for small static projects.
Feel free to contribute, improve or use it for your projects.

### Contains some neat stuff out of the box!

- jQuery
- Bootstrap with Popper.js
- FontAwesome

### Commands?

It's pretty easy... You do not have a bunch of commands, just two of them:

- `npm run serve` â€“ to start with development
- `npm run build` - to make it ready for production use
